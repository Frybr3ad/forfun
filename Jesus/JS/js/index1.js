console.log(` The truth is ${Truth}. Not one person you see God doesnt not love. We can confirm this in His Holy text that He has left for us. One 
scripture to show how much He loves us is "${promise1}". Here it shows that He would give His only precious son
but also that He would take this burrden from us and pay for all of our sins, even though He himself is sinless.
Another is " ${promise2}". He wants us all to be with Him in heaven but He also loves us so much that we get to
choose if we want that or not, but God doesn't want anyone to go to hell. Even though we sin against Him
we still have redemption and can be forgiven through Jesus Christ. It is that easy! Just call on Him and
believe that Jesus Christ is real. That He died for us, bore our debt, and rose again the 3rd day and you will be forgiven. 
Many believe He came for the righteous but it is not them who need saving it is us sinners; we see this in the scripture
that reads "${promise3}". Its not healthy people who need a Doctor its the sick, it's us sinners. 
Don't be afraid of God. He will not hurt you how earthly people have. He will never leave you nor forsake you, 
He will never shame you, or hurt you. He loves us a million times more than we love our own children.
He is our Heavenly Father and our creature. He wants good for us. He has a purpose for each one of us
that He has created. Scripture says "${promise4}", meaning this: that He has created you for a purpose of good
and not bad. He has good planned for you and won't hurt you. Do not fear is written in the bible 365 times.
Coincidence? I don't think so. ${conclusions}.`);
