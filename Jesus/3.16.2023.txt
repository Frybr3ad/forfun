I pray that you touch more and more people everyday, I pray you bless this land. I pray 
for REVIVAL all through the nation. I pray that your Holy Spirit fall upon all of us, I 
pray more and more people come to you like never before and see how wonderful you are how 
faithfull you are, how loving you are, how graceful you are, how forgiving you are, and also
how powerful you are! I pray that all of us followers of Christ RISE UP!! AWAKEN us with
your might! give us power energy and endurance to come against the devil! TO help save and
rescue others, not that its through us Father no way all the honor recognition and glory 
go to you Father it is you who strengthens us not of our own. We are nothing without you, thats 
why I ask that you fill us with these things to go out and win more souls for the kingdom.
We will not be afraid because you have not given us the spirit of fear but of power! strength 
and sound mind! We will remember this is war! and our general is on the way, we go ahead and 
fight small battles while trying to save people while you are preparing for the great war,
that you have already won. To come and stop it once and for all in your way Lord. May we all
fear the WRATH of God, "the fear of God is the begingin of knowledge"; may we be knowledgeable,
wise, smooth, joyful, prepared, suited in the full armor of God. May I seek to serve you all
the days of my life, I am couragious! I am Fearless! I am brave! I am a WARRIOR for the kingdom
of heaven my heavenly Father! I am a mighty princess! I am modest! I am not attention seeking!
I am preserved, I am confident, I am loyal, I am smart, I am beautiful in a kingdom way not in
a worldly way, "God looks to the inside as man looks on the out", I am a child of the MOST HIGH
 THE ALMIGHTY GOD CHRIST THE ONE AND ONLY KING THE ONE AND ONLY LIVING GOD THE ALPHA AND THE 
OMEGA THE BEGINING AND THE END! In Jesus name I pray, Amen <3
