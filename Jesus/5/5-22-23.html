        <h3>Prayer:</h3>
        Lord, <br />
        Thank you for not giving up on me. I know you have not given up on me
        Because I can feel you in my heart and I still have conviction of the
        Holy Spirit and that is proof that you have not left me. Lord I want to
        love you right, I want to make you happy and proud. Please show me how
        to do that. I pray I feel just how much you love me. Help me in all my
        ways in every aspect of my life so that it may be lived pleasing to you.
        Soften my heart, position it in such a way I can recieve your words and
        keep them stored in my mind and heart. Clear my mind of chaos and
        whatever is not of you. May I never drift too far Lord. May I never take
        your love and grace for granted. May I never forget what you did on that
        cross for me that day when you suffered a great deal for my sins even
        though you yourself never sinned. Thank you for paying my debt for me
        for baring my burdens. Thank you for saving me. Thank you for providing
        my every need. Thank you that you are not a liar like some earthly
        fathers. Thank you for keeping your promises. For being there for me
        through every trial and tribulation, through every storm, Lord you have
        always been there for me. I'm sorry I didn't realize it earlier. Forgive
        me Lord for being selfish and so concerned about myself all the time.
        Please help me to love everyone more than myself, to do your will for my
        life. I need you daily Lord and I'm starting to understand more. Please
        let your Holy Spirit surround me in His presence and not leave me to
        invade my life my home my heart and mind. May I be more aware of His
        presence. May He keep guiding me and convicting me. Please don't ever
        stop convicting me, I never want to be confortable sinning. Thank you
        for everything literally everything. I am so grateful, thankful, and
        appreciative of everything you have done for my family and I. I love you
        and I pray these things in Jesus Christ name, <br />
        Amen..
