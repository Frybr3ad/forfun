        <h3>Prayer:</h3>
        <h4>
          Dear Lord, <br />
          I want to start of by saying Hi, I love you. I want to take a min to
          just be in your presence, like if I am here in front of you; at your
          feet... (break...)... May this be the last day I ever put man above
          you and above myself, let it be the last day I ever people please.
          Thank you for open eyes, for open ears, and an open heart to recieve
          your word, learn, and install your word. Thank you for working on me,
          for leading me and helping me. Please continue to help me. Keep
          working on me. Keep opening my eyes and teaching me how to follow you.
          Please dont give up on me. I just want to please you not man. Bring me
          back to the old me in a sense to where I wanted to stand for
          something. Take away my doubled mindedness and replace it with
          Holiness. I welcome your Holy Spirit in my everyday life. Forgive me
          for grieving your Holy Spirit and not acknowledging Him as much as I
          ought to. Change me Oh God and let me be who you created me to be. As
          well as my family too. In Jesus name I pray,
          <br />
          Amen.
